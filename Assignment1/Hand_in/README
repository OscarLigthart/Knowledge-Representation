This SAT solver was completely written in Python.
Everything can be found in the Source_Code.zip file.

Please set the directory holding all the source code to your current directory in the terminal and use the command line below to test the code:

python SAT.py --heuristic "S1" --sudoku_files "concatenated-sudoku.txt"

Heuristics work for S1, S2 and S3. Please insert either one of them within the quotes.
Please make sure the "concatenated-sudoku.txt" is a text file which holds a concatenation of the sudoku rules along with the given sudoku puzzle in DIMACS format (in that order).
This .txt file has to be in the same folder as the python scripts.

It is also possible to use one of the human strategies to solve a sudoku:

python SAT.py --heuristic "S1" --sudoku_files "concatenated-sudoku.txt" --strategy "naked-pairs"

For the strategies there is a choice of:
 - naked-pairs
 - naked-triples
 - x-wings
 - all

Please insert any one of them into the quotes behind --strategy.
